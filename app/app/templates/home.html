        <p>Welcome to CEDARS!</p>
        <p>CEDARS (Clinical Event Detection and Recording System) is a computational paradigm for collection and aggregation of time-to-event data in retrospective clinical studies. Developed out of a practical need for a more efficient way to conduct medical research, it aims to systematize and accelerate the review of electronic health record (EHR) corpora. It accomplishes those goals by deploying natural language processing (NLP) as a tool to assist detection and characterization of clinical events by human abstractors. In its current iteration, CEDARS is available as an open-source R package under GPL-3 license. The latest stable package can be downloaded from CRAN and the most recent development version can be cloned from GitHub. Full documentation is available here..</p>
