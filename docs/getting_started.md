# Getting Started

## Installation
To install CEDARS on your computer you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your computer.
2. Download the [CEDARS docker folder]().
3. Open the docker application on your computer.
4. Go to the Containers tab in docker.
5. Click the start button under Actions for the CEDARS project.
6. Navigate to the "http://localhost:5001" URL in your browser.
7. CEDARS will now be running on this webpage.

# First Usage
The first time that a CEDARS project has been opened, you will see a page prompting you to enter an admin username and password. After this the project will load the interface as normal.

## Continued Usage
After the installation has been complete, CEDARS will continue to run on the same URL until docker is shut down. To start the application again, follow steps 3. - 7. from the Installation section. Note that all data and progress in the project will be saved even after docker shuts down.
