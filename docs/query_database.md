# Querying the Database

To search for medical events using CEDARS you will need to write a [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) query. For more information regarding these queries, you can refer to the Basic Concepts section of the documentation. After you enter a query, click submit and the NLP algorithm will run on the database and save instances of the event when it is found. After the database has been searched, you will be redirected to the Adjudications page where you can view the search results.

# Important Note 
Keep in mind that entering a new query will erase all records of the prior query and so you are advised to download a copy of the results of prior queries before entering a new one.
