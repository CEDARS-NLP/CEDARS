# About

CEDARS was created out of a need to more efficiently annotate patient datasets for clinical events. The initial application was for the assessment of a venous thromboembolism endpoint in a cohort of patients with cancer, however early on we decided to develop this software platform as a general purpose tool aimed at a broad array of clinical endpoints. The original implementation was in R programming language but more recently the code base was ported to Python. CEDARS is under development at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \(MSKCC\)](https://www.mskcc.org).
