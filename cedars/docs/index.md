# Welcome to CEDARS

CEDARS is an open source software designed to aid researchers in quickly finding relevant events and their corresponding dates within large corpuses of medical notes.

## Background
CEDARS (Clinical Event Detection and Recording System) is a computational paradigm for collection and aggregation of time-to-event data in retrospective clinical studies. Developed out of a practical need for a more efficient way to conduct medical research, it aims to systematize and accelerate the review of electronic health record (EHR) corpora. It accomplishes those goals by deploying natural language processing (NLP) as a tool to assist detection and characterization of clinical events by human abstractors. In its current iteration, CEDARS is available as an open-source python package using a mongodb database. The latest stable package can be downloaded as a docker image from github and the most recent development version can be cloned from out [github](https://www.mkdocs.org). Full documentation is available here.
